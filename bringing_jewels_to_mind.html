            The Bringing the Three Jewels to Mind Sutra
          </h1>

          <p>
            I bow down before the Omniscient One.<br>
            The Buddha, the Glorious One, the Transcendant Victor, is the Arhat who has overcome all foes,<br>
            The Perfectly Authentic Awakened One, the Knowing and Venerable One.<br>
            He is the Sugata who has attained happiness, the Knower of the Universe, He Who Governs Beings.<br>
            He is the Unsurpassable, the Teacher of gods and humans: the Glorious Buddha. <br>
            The Tatagatha is in harmony with all sources of merit.<br>
            His roots of virtue are never depleted.<br>
            He is perfectly adorned with patience.<br>
            He is the foundation of the treasure of merit.<br>
            He is graced by the excellent minor marks.<br>
            The blossoms of his major marks have fully bloomed.<br>
            His activity and conduct are timely and relevant.<br>
            Those who behold him see harmony only.<br>
            Those who turn to him with trust are fully delighted.<br>
            The brilliance of his superior wisdom can not be eclipsed.<br>
            His powers are unassailable.<br>
            He is the Teacher of all sentient beings.<br>
            He is the father of all Bodhisattvas.<br>
            He is the monarch of all Noble Ones.<br>
            He is the captain who transports beings to the city beyond sorrow.<br>
            His wisdom is immeasurable.<br>
            His confidence is inconceivable.<br>
            His speech is perfectly pure.<br>
            His voice is melodious.<br>
            One never tires of looking at him.<br>
            His enlightened appearance is incomparable.<br>
            He is untainted by the desire realms.<br>
            He is unsullied by the form realms.<br>
            He has never integrated the formless realms.<br>
            He is absolutely liberated from all suffering.<br>
            He is entirely free of the samsaric aggregates.<br>
            He has none of the elements of ordinary existence. <br>
            He has mastered the sources of the sense faculties.<br>
            He has completely cut through the knot of afflictions.<br>
            He is totally liberated from anguish and misery.<br>
            He is free of craving.<br>
            He has crossed the river.<br>
            He is the perfection of timeless wisdom.<br>
            He is the timeless wisdom of the Glorious Buddhas of the past, of the present,<br>
            and of the future.<br>
            He does not remain in Nirvana.<br>
            He dwells in absolute truth.<br>
            He abides on the plane where he can look upon all sentient beings.<br>
            These are the exalted, perfect qualities of the Glorious Buddha’s enlightened form.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            The True Dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good at the end.<br>
            Its meaning is excellent.<br>
            Its terms and syllables are excellent.<br>
            It is clear and well-defined.<br>
            It is absolutely complete.<br>
            It is altogether pure.<br>
            It is utterly refined.<br>
            The excellent expression of the Glorious One’s teaching gives perfect understanding.<br>
            It is without afflictions.<br>
            It is never-ending.<br>
            It precisely suits the purpose.<br>
            Its significance is grasped through insight.<br>
            It is personally confirmed by the knowledge of the Capable Ones.<br>
            The Dharma taught by the Glorious One skillfully demonstrates how the mind is tamed.<br>
            It involves truly renouncing.<br>
            It directs us to full awakening.<br>
            It is comprehensive, reliable, and without contradiction.<br>
            It brings all digressions to an end.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            The renunciant community of the great vehicle, the Mahayana sangha, has superbly entered the path. <br>
            Its members have entered with discernment.<br>
            They have entered with sincerity.<br>
            They have entered into harmony.<br>
            They are worthy of our gestures of respect.<br>
            They are worthy of our prostrations.<br>
            They are a magnificent field of merit; the act of offering to them is complete training and purification.<br>
            They are the great, all-inclusive sphere of our generosity.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            The Buddha’s qualities are inconceivable,<br>
            just as the true Dharma is inconceivable,<br>
            and the noble Sangha is inconceivable.<br>
            Once confidence in such inconceivable qualities has arisen,<br>
            their full ripening is also inconceivable.<br>
          </p>
